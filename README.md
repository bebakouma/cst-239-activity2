## üß© Activity Breakdown

### Part 1: Super Hero Battle
- Demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism using `SuperHero`, `Batman`, and `Superman` classes.
- Includes game logic to simulate a turn-based battle.

### Part 2: Weapons, Bombs, and Guns
- Uses abstract classes and method overloading/overriding.
- `Weapon` is an abstract class extended by `Bomb` and `Gun`.

### Part 3: Comparing Person Objects
- Shows how to override `equals()` and `toString()` in a `Person` class.
- Demonstrates comparison logic between objects.

### Part 4: Debugging Practice
- Explores the Eclipse debugger.
- Screenshots and a summary document demonstrate breakpoints and variable inspection.

This activity has multiple parts. All parts must be completed prior to documentation submission.

Part 1: Super Hero Battle

In this activity, you will learn how to create classes in Java and apply inheritance to those classes.

Part 2: Weapons, Bombs, and Guns

In this activity, you will learn how to design classes in Java and apply inheritance to those classes using an abstract class, as well as overload and override some of the class methods.

Part 3: How to Compare Person Objects

In this activity, you will learn how to compare object and print objects in Java by overriding the equals() method and toString() method.

Part 4: Using the Debugger

In this activity you will continue to practice using the debugger.
